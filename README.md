# Mohamed Yusuf Mohamed

Software Engineering graduate with First Class Honours from the University of Westminster.
I build reliable systems with a strong focus on backend development, data handling, and scalable application design. My work spans full-stack web applications, concurrent Java systems, Android apps, and data-driven tools. I am particularly interested in growing as a backend and systems-focused Software Engineer.

## About Me

I enjoy solving problems properly.
I am not interested in quick fixes or surface-level solutions. I prefer understanding how a system works end to end, identifying root causes, and designing clean, maintainable code that lasts.

My work often focuses on:
- Backend development using Java, Node.js, and SQL
- API design and RESTful services
- Data modelling and database integration
- Concurrency and multithreaded systems
- Building full-stack applications with structured architecture

I am currently aiming to deepen my knowledge in:
- Scalable backend systems
- Database architecture and performance
- Distributed systems fundamentals
- Cloud-native application design

## Core Strengths

- Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and software design
- Persistent problem-solver who works through complex bugs methodically
- Fast learner who adapts quickly to new technologies
- Detail-oriented with a focus on code clarity and maintainability
- Comfortable working both independently and in collaborative teams

## What I'm Working Towards

I want to build systems that operate at scale.
My goal is to grow into a backend-focused Software Engineer working on performance-critical, data-intensive, or distributed systems. I am particularly interested in roles where strong computer science fundamentals matter and where engineering quality is taken seriously.
